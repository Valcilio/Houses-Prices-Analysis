**PREMISES:**

This project has as premise to help the company "House Sales in King County, USA", to find good home buying opportunities and then be able to resell for a higher price and thus obtain a higher profit thanks to this.

House Rocket asked on the basis of two main questions:

1. What properties to buy and how much to sell them?

2. When is the best time to sell these properties?

In this way, this project has as premises to be able to answer these questions, and also to produce other relevant insights that may be able to have an impact in decision-making and, consequently, in the business itself.

**Solution Plan:**

The planning can be said to be divided into 4 parts: good buying opportunities, increase in the price to be able to sell, best time for resale and chances to be validated or devalued. Thus, the details of each one are as follows:

Purchasing opportunities> at this point the analysis was carried out in ascending order considering the following aspects: size, price, floors, water view, number of bedrooms and bathrooms. All these aspects in ascending order and the more they were fulfilled, the better the ranking being in that order: Bad - Good - Great - Excellent.

Increase in the price of houses for resale> was carried out according to a study of the average price of houses with these conditions and their offers.

Best time for resale> was carried out according to an analysis of the average price in the seasons of the year, thus finding what would be the most ideal time.

10 hypotheses were taken, which were validated or devalued in the course of this project:

H1 - The price of houses with conditions 3 to 4 in relation to houses with condition 1 is about 41% higher.

H2 - The price of houses with 2 to 4 bedrooms in relation to houses without bedrooms is 38.27% higher or more.

H3 - The price of houses with 2 to 4 bathrooms in relation to houses without a bathroom is equal to or greater than 49.30%.

H4 - The price of houses with 2 floors in relation to houses with only 1 floor is equal to or greater than 26.10%.

H5 - Houses with a water view have a price 67.86% higher than houses without a water view.

H6 - The best opportunities are found mostly in south seattle.

H7: The north has the highest priced houses.

H8 - The annual growth in house prices is around 5%.

H9 - The monthly house price growth is somewhat linear, always maintaining price stability.

H10 - Houses before 1960 have a lower average price.

**Financial Results**

It is expected that House Rocket will choose to purchase in general the houses that have been classified as excellent offers according to the analysis provided and thus be able to obtain a return of about 40% additional profit thanks to this strategy.

Thus, excluding the taxes levied in the USA, I believe it is possible to see an increase of about 35% in gross revenue and at least 30% in the company's net profit.

**Next Steps**

As next steps, it is expected that an organization will be made in order to implement a machine learning algorithm that helps House Rocket to be able to carry out these analyzes in a much faster and more dynamic way, in addition to the need to update the portfolio and also to keep in mind the houses already evaluated in case there are changes in their states and opportunities can be found.

**Conclusion**

House Rocket, with the help of the analyzes provided in this project, will be able to address interesting purchase offers and make sales that are advantageous for it, in addition to being able to better understand the business itself and also take advantage of the insights obtained through this project to reach new brands in the current market. Thus, managing to grow your profit and keep updating to remain more solid.
